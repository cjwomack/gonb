const HelpMessage = `GoNB is a Go kernel that compiles and executed on-the-fly Go code. 

When executing a cell, *GoNB* will save the cell contents (except non-Go commands see
below) into a "main.go" file, compile and execute it.

It also saves any global declarations (imports, functions, types, variables, constants)
and reuse them at the next cell execution -- so you can define a function in one
cell, and reuse in the next one. Just the "func main()" is not reused.

A "hello world" example would look like:

	func main() {
		fmt.Printf("Hello world!\n");
	}

But to avoid having to type "func main()" all the time, you can use "%%" and everything
after is wrapped inside a "func main() { ... }". So our revised "hello world" looks like:

	%%
	fmt.Printf("Hello world!\n")


- "init()" functions: since there is always only one definition per function name, 
  it's not possible for each cell to have it's own init() function. Instead GoNB
  converts any function named "init_<my_stuff>()" to "init()" before compiling and
  executing. This way each cell can create its own "init_...()" and have it called
  at every cell execution.

Special non-Go commands: 

- "%%" or "%main": Marks the lines as follows to be wrapped in a "func main() {...}" during 
  execution. A shortcut to quickly execute code. It also automatically includes "flag.Parse()"
  as the very first statement. Anything "%%" or "%main" are taken as arguments
  to be passed to the program -- it resets previous values given by "%args".
- "%args": Sets arguments to be passed when executing the Go code. This allows one to
  use flags as a normal program. Notice that if a value after "%%" or "%main" is given, it will
  overwrite the values here.
- "%autoget" and "%noautoget": Default is "%autoget", which automatically does "go get" for
  packages not yet available.
- "%env VAR value": Sets the environment variable VAR to the given value. These variables
  will be available both for Go code as well as for shell scripts.
- "%reset": clears all memorized declarations (imports, functions, variables, types and 
  constants).
- "%with_inputs": will prompt for inputs for the next shell command. Use this if
  the next shell command ("!") you execute reads the stdin. Jupyter will require
  you to enter one last value after the shell script executes.
- "%with_password": will prompt for a password passed to the next shell command.
  Do this is if your next shell command requires a password.

Executing shell commands:

- "!<shell_cmd>": executes the given command on a new shell. It makes it easy to run
  commands on the kernels box, for instance to install requirements, or quickly
  check contents of directories or files. Lines ending in "\" are continued on
  the next line -- so multi-line commands can be entered. But each command is
  executed in its own shell, that is, variables and state is not carried over.
- "!*<shell_cmd>": same as "!<shell_cmd>" except it first changes directory to
  the temporary directory used to compile the go code -- the latest execution
  is always saved in the file "main.go". It's also where the "go.mod" file for
  the notebook is created and maintained. Useful for manipulating "go.mod",
  for instance to get a package from some specific version, something 
  like "!*go get github.com/my/package@v3".
